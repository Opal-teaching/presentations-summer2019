# Summer 2019 Bootcamp

## Material to Cover

Below, you'll find a list of all the different things to cover during the summer 2019 Opal bootcamp. The items below don't need to be followed in any order, except for the assignments which are numbered and sometimes follow a specific presentation (this will be mentioned). I've included some links for tutorials to learn the different languages, but you can use any other resource that you prefer.

### Languages and Frameworks

Go through a tutorial for all languages and frameworks below, to learn them for the first time or as a refresher. Skip any language that you're already comfortable with.

* Javascript ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript))

* Asynchronous Javascript & Promises (Day 3 presentation, [article on asynchronous JS](http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/exactly-makes-javascript-weird-programming-language/), [article on callbacks](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/introduction-to-asynchronous-javascript))

* AngularJS (*note*: make sure to study AngularJS (Angular 1), not Angular 2 or higher) ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/angular/default.asp), [JohnPapa Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md))

* Git ([Interactive tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/git/index.htm), [Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123))

* Beginner's HTML and CSS ([W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/))

* Beginner's SQL ([SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/))

* Node.js (if you know Javascript, you'll be able to use Node.js, but you can look at the [Node.js Guides](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/) if you want to learn more)

### Assignments

Complete the following assignments, made by David Herrera in summer 2018. They're meant to help you try out the concepts introduced in the presentations. There is no one right answer for these excercises; you may need to do some Googling to find ways to make everything work.

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/messaging-app) ("Hello World the Opal Way", in the repository "messaging-app"): Given on day 2 of bootcamp, this assignment will teach you about the fundamentals of the Opal app frontend setup. Don't complete the whole messaging app right away, just start with "Hello World the Opal Way".

* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/async_js_assignment) (in repository "async_js_assignment"): Given on day 3 of bootcamp, to do after the presentation on asynchronous JavaScript and Promises.

* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/firebase-simple-app) (in repository "firebase-simple-app"): Given on day 4 of bootcamp, to do after the presentation on AngularJS filters and Firebase.

* [Assignment 4](https://github.com/Opal-teaching/messaging-app) (in repository "messaging-app"): The last assignment of bootcamp. This one can be started at any time, but you'll be best equiped to do it after the presentation on AngularJS filters and Firebase on day 4.

### Presentations

All presentations given during bootcamp are available in this repository. Refer back to them when needed.

### Documentation

Read through the documentation relevant to your project(s). Below are the projects for this summer.

* OpalCare (all documentation is listed in the section "OpalCare" of the Day 1 presentation)
